Challenge: Random Insult Generator

1. Create an array with four different body parts and assign the array to the variable randomBodyParts. Some examples of body parts would be: head, arms, legs, feet, toes, hips.

2. Create an array with four adjectives and assign the array to the variable randomAdjectives.

3. Create an array with five random words and assign to the array to the variable randomWords.

4. Use the Math.floor() method and the Math.random() method to choose a random item from your randomBodyParts array and assign it to the variable randomBodyPart. Here is an example of how we might choose a random name from a list of names. If you get stuck you can watch me walk through this in the solution video.

var randomNames = ['John', 'Sally', 'Alex'];
var randomName = randomNames[Math.floor(Math.random() * 3)];
5. Use the Math.floor() method and the Math.random() method to choose a random item from your randomAdjectives array and assign it to the variable randomAdjective. Here is an example of how we might choose a random name from a list of names.

6. Use the Math.floor() method and the Math.random() method to choose a random item from your randomWords array and assign it to the variable randomWord. Here is an example of how we might choose a random name from a list of names.

7. Write a console.log statement that displays your randomly generated insult:

Your BODY PART is like a ADJECTIVE WORD!!!
Replace  "BODY PART" with randomBodyPart, "ADJECTIVE" with randomAdjective, and  "WORD" with randomWord in the sentence above.
